# Blink your backlight keyboard.
### steps to do this: 

1) Fire up your terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t (or else clicking the logo like a noob!)
2) clone this repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavansrinivasmamidala/blinking_keyboard
```
3) change permissions 
```bash
chmod +x blink
```
4) go into root (sudo su or su)
```bash
sudo su 
```
5) run the script 
```bash
./blink.sh
```
6) It asks for the time interval enter any number below 3 as you wouldn't call it blinking if it's more than that..!!

  TIP: You can enter decimal values too(I recommend 0.45)

  !!! Only run this in sudo as we need root access to change the brightness level of the keyboard !!!
